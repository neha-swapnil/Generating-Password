# Generating-Password
Password generation using Java.

This module could be included in web or mobile projects including login,registrations where people sometimes forget their passwords.
This module could help the admin to auto-generate a password so that the user can login using that and then change his password.
And every time we get a different password.
These kind of random OTPs and Passwords are much safer than Static passwords.

Sample OUTPUTS include:-
VV&FF_/FDM, &udeC^@Gw4, )8g=&BF9^O, 8KVYUthLCs, KT+&ih$gX., ud&?>R&tG$
